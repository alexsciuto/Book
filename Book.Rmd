# Chapter One

I hop out of the shower, soap dripping down the hairs behind my leg and god knows where else, as I almost slip on my old bath mat overlayed with a cartoon frog pattern. I grab the stained towel resting atop my porcelain toilet, quickly drying my hair as the podcast discussing Plato’s Symposium is interrupted by the piercing sound of my alarm reminding me I am 15 minutes behind schedule. Alarm singing, I squint my eyes as if I can look past the fog lying between my mirror and the Daulter the world will see, trying to fix my hair. I give up, grab my phone, and throw the towel back on the toilet, missing completely, for tomorrow’s use.

I run out the bathroom door to my dresser, letting out an obscured mist that dissipates immediately. I jump into a pair of underwear, slide on some mismatched dress socks absorbing the soapy water between my toes, put deodorant on, struggle putting on my tight black jeans through my undried legs, force on my pine-brown dress shoes without the time to tie them, and button down my short-sleeve dress shirt patterned with small, but visible, forget-me-nots contrasted with a plain black background. I grab my black backpack that is thrown on the floor with all of my other clothes and shit, lying between my copy of Nietzsche’s “Twilight of the Idols” and Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling”. I stop for a second, staring at Isaac’s eyes screaming for help through the “Penguin Classics” cover art displaying Abraham’s hand holding his throat to the floor, while he is pressing a rusted knife against his young son’s fair skin with the other. I pause for a second, literally. I quickly realize it is the muffled noise of my phone alarm in my pocket screaming, not Isaac, reminding me I don’t have time to shit around, and I grab the book with me. 

I sprint to the other side of my poorly lit studio apartment, grabbing everything I can on the way, passing the kitchenette and walking through the door as I am blinded by the San Diego sun. Covering my face with my hands from the Sun’s truthful presence, hiding just behind its shadow so I can see, I run down the stairs, pass the un-pressure washed concrete floor, and dive into my 2015 Toyota Corolla’s driver seat. I turn on the car, turn off the cursed chorus of a fucking phone alarm, and drive out of my complex toward the class I have at 9:30 am in Late modern Philosophy. Startling me, my phone syncs with the bluetooth stereo in my car resuming the podcast on the Symposium. The soft, yet crass, tone of the podcaster’s voice emanates through my car resuming his description of Aristophanes account of love that is immeasurably different from
