# Chapter One

I hop out of the shower, soap dripping down the hairs behind my leg and god knows where else, as I almost slip on my old bath mat overlayed with a cartoon frog pattern. I grab the stained towel resting atop my porcelain toilet, quickly drying my hair as the podcast discussing Plato’s Symposium is interrupted by the piercing sound of my alarm reminding me I am 15 minutes behind schedule. Alarm singing, I squint my eyes as if I can look past the fog lying between my mirror and the Daulter the world will see, trying to fix my hair. I give up, grab my phone, and throw the towel back on the toilet, missing completely, for tomorrow’s use.

I run out the bathroom door to my dresser, letting out an obscured mist that dissipates immediately. I jump into a pair of underwear, slide on some mismatched dress socks absorbing the soapy water between my toes, put deodorant on, struggle putting on my tight black jeans through my undried legs, force on my pine-brown dress shoes without the time to tie them, and button down my short-sleeve dress shirt patterned with small, but visible, forget-me-nots contrasted with a plain black background. I grab my black backpack that is thrown on the floor with all of my other clothes and shit, lying between my copy of Nietzsche’s “Twilight of the Idols” and Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling”. I stop for a second, staring at Isaac’s eyes screaming for help through the “Penguin Classics” cover art displaying Abraham’s hand holding his throat to the floor, while he is pressing a rusted knife against his young son’s fair skin with the other. I pause for a second, literally. I quickly realize it is the muffled noise of my phone alarm in my pocket screaming, not Isaac, reminding me I don’t have time to shit around, and I grab the book with me. 

I sprint to the other side of my poorly lit studio apartment, grabbing everything I can on the way, passing the kitchenette and walking through the door as I am blinded by the San Diego sun. Covering my face with my hands from the Sun’s truthful presence, hiding just behind its shadow so I can see, I run down the stairs, pass the un-pressure washed concrete floor, and dive into my 2015 Toyota Corolla’s driver seat. I turn on the car, turn off the cursed chorus of a fucking phone alarm, and drive out of my complex toward the class I have at 9:30 am in Late modern Philosophy. Startling me, my phone syncs with the bluetooth stereo in my car resuming the podcast on the Symposium. The soft, yet crass, tone of the podcaster’s voice emanates through my car resuming his description of Aristophanes account of love that is immeasurably different from that of Phaedrus, Pausanias, and Eryximachus. 

I place my arm on the passenger seat while looking back, and I reverse the car out of my parking spot to then propel forward like a torpedo. I roll down the windows and briefly look outside at the blue sky which is ever so slightly sprinkled with cotton-candy clouds. Distracted by the clouds, I finally refocus and tune back into the podcast.  

>“Aristophanes’ account of love in the symposium is fitting for his role as a comedian, some even argue it is to be interpreted as a joke! He proposed humans existed with two arms and two legs, toiling and rolling around the earth with power that could even challenge those of gods! Zeus grew jealous and smote humans in half with his righteous bolts, separating them from their original soul mate. For this reason human’s always feel a gripe of loneliness, and love is simply finally being able to reunite with your lost half. That is why they say!—when you lock eyes with your true love, you can’t help but feel a pang of familiarity and nostalgia".

I drop my hand out the window while racing down I15 toward UCSD and turn toward my left seeing a glimpse of the glistening california coastline in the distance. “Huh, so i'm just here to look for my other half? Who is to say you would ever meet them? What are the chances?” At the thought of that the light of the sun reflects from the bright red volkswagen speeding up behind me, into my mirror, then to my eyes clumsily not wearing shades. Slightly blinded, I bring my hand from outside to cover my eyes, then see something interesting in the clouds. I see this scenery of two dense clouds, nearly touching but not quite, with a stream of celadon-blue sky between them. It almost looks like Zeus’ lighting bolt, but I then notice it is a little too water-like to originate from the sky where he resides. Almost looking like a river of some sort. I rub my eyes, and the pain of the glare is gone, where I look back and see the clouds part quickly as the ocean breeze pushes them astray. I put my eyes back on the road watching my eyes melt with the asphalt as I drive, where I continue to listen to the podcast till I get there.
